    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "Solution": "Inspiration is an active process involving muscle contraction. The diaphragm contracts and flattens, and the external intercostal muscles contract, lifting the ribs and sternum upwards and outwards. These actions increase the volume of the thoracic cavity, which in turn leads to a decrease in intra-pleural pressure (it becomes more negative). This decrease in intra-pleural pressure causes the lungs to expand, leading to a decrease in intra-pulmonary (intrapulmonic) pressure below atmospheric pressure, allowing air to rush into the lungs. Therefore, an increase in intra-pleural pressure does not occur during inspiration; rather, it decreases.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "Solution": "Toluene has a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the benzene ring. The methyl group is an ortho-, para- directing and activating group for electrophilic aromatic substitution. In Friedel-Crafts alkylation with CH₃Cl/AlCl₃, the electrophile is CH₃⁺. This electrophile will attack the ortho and para positions of toluene, leading to the formation of o-Xylene (1,2-dimethylbenzene) and p-Xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene). The para product is usually major due to less steric hindrance, but a mixture is formed.",

    "Solution": "For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is t = (2.303/k) log([A]₀/[A]t). If 80% of the reaction is completed, then 20% of the reactant remains. So, [A]t = 0.20 [A]₀, which means [A]₀/[A]t = 1/0.20 = 5. Given k = 6.93 × 10⁻³ s⁻¹. t = (2.303 / (6.93 × 10⁻³)) log(5). We know log(5) ≈ 0.699. t = (2.303 / 6.93) × 10³ × 0.699. (2.303 / 6.93) is approximately 1/3. So, t ≈ (1/3) × 10³ × 0.699 ≈ 0.333 × 699 ≈ 232.767 s. Alternatively, t½ = 0.693/k = 0.693 / (6.93 × 10⁻³) = 100 s. For 80% completion, it's more than one half-life and less than three half-lives (75% completion is 2 half-lives = 200s; 87.5% completion is 3 half-lives = 300s). Using the formula: t = (2.303/k) log(100/(100-80)) = (2.303/(6.93 × 10⁻³)) log(100/20) = (2.303/(6.93 × 10⁻³)) log(5) ≈ (2.303/(6.93 × 10⁻³)) × 0.6989 ≈ 232.2 s.",

    "Solution": "In the Lac operon, the repressor protein, in the absence of lactose, binds to the operator region, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes. When lactose (or its isomer allolactose) is present, it acts as an inducer by binding to the repressor protein. This binding causes a conformational change in the repressor, making it unable to bind to the operator. As a result, RNA polymerase can access the promoter and transcribe the structural genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA).",

This is primarily mediated by auxins, such as Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA), produced in the apical bud. Auxins move downwards and suppress the growth of lateral buds.

Its primary role is to increase water reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting ducts of the nephrons in the kidney. This reduces water loss in urine (antidiuresis). Aldosterone primarily regulates sodium reabsorption (and indirectly water). ANF promotes sodium excretion and diuresis.

Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands are a classic example, where an ancestral finch species radiated into multiple species with different beak shapes adapted to different food sources.
