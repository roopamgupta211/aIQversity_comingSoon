While it often brings economic opportunities, improved infrastructure, and access to better education and healthcare, it also presents significant challenges. Overcrowding, pollution, housing shortages, and increased strain on resources like water and energy are common issues in rapidly urbanizing regions. Effective urban planning and sustainable development strategies are crucial to mitigate these negative impacts and harness the potential benefits of urbanization. This involves investing in public transportation, affordable housing, green spaces, and waste management systems. Furthermore, fostering inclusive growth ensures that the benefits of urban development reach all segments of the population, preventing the exacerbation of social inequalities. The future of our planet is increasingly urban, making it imperative to create cities that are not only economically vibrant but also environmentally sustainable and socially equitable.\n\nWhat is the primary focus of the passage?",

    "Solution": "The reporting verb 'said to' changes to 'told'. \nThe conjunction 'that' is used. \nThe pronoun 'I' (first person) changes to 'he' (third person, according to the subject of the reporting verb). \nThe verb 'am' (present tense) changes to 'was' (past tense) because the reporting verb 'said' is in the past tense. \nSo, \"He told me that he was ready.\"",

    "Question": "Rearrange the parts of the sentence in correct order. \nP: for its rich biodiversity \nQ: is a popular tourist destination \nR: The national park, \nS: and stunning landscapes",
    "options": {
      "a": "RQPS",

      "c": "QPSR",
      "d": "PRSQ"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "Solution": "The sentence should start with the subject. 'R' (The national park,) introduces the subject. 'P' (for its rich biodiversity) and 'S' (and stunning landscapes) provide reasons or characteristics related to the national park. 'Q' (is a popular tourist destination) acts as the predicate, completing the sentence. So, R is followed by P and S (which can be in PS or SP order, but PS sounds more natural as a combined reason). Then Q concludes. RPSQ: \"The national park, for its rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes, is a popular tourist destination.\"",
    "step_by_step": [
      "Identify the part that introduces the main subject of the sentence. 'R' (The national park,) seems like a good starting point as it introduces a noun phrase that can act as a subject.",
      "Look for parts that describe or add information to the subject. 'P' (for its rich biodiversity) and 'S' (and stunning landscapes) explain why the national park might be notable. 'P' and 'S' are connected by 'and', so they should likely be together, with 'S' following 'P' or vice-versa if it makes sense.",
      "Look for the main verb or predicate that completes the sentence. 'Q' (is a popular tourist destination) provides the predicate for 'The national park'.",
      "Try to form a coherent sentence by arranging these parts.",
      "R: The national park,",
      "P: for its rich biodiversity",
      "S: and stunning landscapes",
      "Q: is a popular tourist destination.",
      "Combining them: \"The national park, for its rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes, is a popular tourist destination.\" This order is RPSQ.",
      "Consider alternative logical flows. RQPS: \"The national park is a popular tourist destination for its rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes.\" This is also grammatically correct. However, the structure 'Subject, [descriptive phrase/clause], Predicate' is common for emphasis or providing context before the main action/statement. RPSQ fits this structure well, where 'for its rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes' acts as a descriptive phrase modifying 'The national park' before the main verb 'is'. The comma after 'The national park,' in R also suggests that a modifying phrase might follow before the main verb.",
      "The combination 'for its rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes' (PS) forms a cohesive descriptive unit. Placing this unit after the subject (R) and before the predicate (Q) results in the sequence RPSQ."
