In the context of Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) as defined by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Hedge Funds and Venture Capital are classified as AIFs. Bonds and Stocks, on the other hand, are considered traditional investment avenues and do not fall under the AIF category. \n\n- **Bonds**: These are fixed-income instruments and are not classified as AIFs. They are typically considered part of the conventional investment landscape. \n- **Hedge Funds**: These are pooled investment funds that employ various strategies to earn active return for their investors and are classified as AIFs. \n- **Stocks**: Like bonds, stocks are also traditional investments and do not qualify as AIFs. \n- **Venture Capital**: This involves investing in startups and small businesses with high growth potential and is recognized as an AIF. \n\nThus, only Hedge Funds and Venture Capital are treated as Alternative Investment Funds, making the total count two.",

        "solution": "The correct option is 'I, II and V'. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has several sources of income, which include: \n1. Buying and selling Government bonds (I): This is a primary source of income for the RBI as it manages the government's borrowing program and earns interest on these bonds. \n2. Buying and selling foreign currency (II): The RBI conducts foreign exchange operations, which also generate income through the management of foreign currency reserves. \n3. Printing and distributing currency notes (V): While this is a function of the RBI, it does not directly generate income in the traditional sense; however, it does have implications for the overall monetary policy and can affect income indirectly through seigniorage. \n\nThe incorrect options are: \n- Option 'b' (II, III and IV): While II is correct, III (Pension fund management) is not a source of income for the RBI. The RBI does not manage pension funds. \n- Option 'c' (I, III, IV and V): Again, III is incorrect, and IV (Lending to private companies) is not a direct source of income for the RBI as it primarily lends to banks and not directly to private companies. \n- Option 'a' (I and II only): This option excludes V, which is also a valid source of income, making it incomplete. \n\nThus, the correct answer is 'I, II and V'.",

Instead, the requirement for BRSR submission is mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for the top 1000 listed companies based on market capitalization. Statement II is correct as the BRSR primarily focuses on non-financial disclosures related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, which are essential for stakeholders to understand a company's sustainability practices.

Statement II is also correct as rural agricultural land is not treated as a capital asset under the Income-tax Act, 1961, which means that any income derived from the sale of such land is not subject to capital gains tax.

        "solution": "Statement II is correct as India's stock market has indeed seen significant growth and has at times outperformed Hong Kong's stock market in terms of market capitalization and trading volumes. Statement I is misleading; while India has a growing equity options market, it does not account for a very large portion of all equity option contracts traded globally. Statement III is also correct; there are concerns regarding the lack of regulatory oversight for small investors in options trading, and the presence of unregistered financial advisors poses risks. Therefore, the correct answer is 'II and III only'. Statement I is incorrect, which eliminates options 'a' and 'd'.",

The components of the Non-Cooperation Programme included: I. Boycott of law-courts and foreign cloth - This was indeed a part of the programme as it aimed to undermine British authority and promote indigenous goods. II. Observance of strict non-violence - This was a fundamental principle of the Non-Cooperation movement, emphasizing that all actions should be non-violent. III. Retention of titles and honours without using them in public - This was not a part of the Non-Cooperation Programme; in fact, Gandhi encouraged Indians to renounce titles and honours conferred by the British. IV.

Rajendra Chola I was a prominent ruler of the Chola dynasty who is known for his military expeditions, particularly against the Srivijaya Empire in Southeast Asia. His campaigns in the early 11th century were aimed at expanding Chola influence and trade routes in the region, leading to significant victories over Srivijaya, which was a powerful maritime state controlling trade in the Malay Peninsula and surrounding areas. \n\nOption 'a', Amoghavarsha (Rashtrakuta), is incorrect as he was known for his contributions to literature and culture rather than military campaigns against Srivijaya. \n\nOption 'b', Prataparudra (Kakatiya), is also incorrect as he was primarily focused on consolidating power in the Deccan region and did not engage in campaigns against Srivijaya. \n\nOption 'd', Vishnuvardhana (Hoysala), is incorrect as his reign was marked by conflicts with the Cholas and the Western Chalukyas, but he did not lead a campaign against Srivijaya. \n\nThus, Rajendra I's successful military campaign against Srivijaya is well-documented in historical texts, making option 'c' the correct choice.",

The 'Pradeshika' was in charge of a province or district, overseeing local administration and ensuring the implementation of royal edicts. The 'Rajuka' was responsible for revenue collection and maintaining law and order, while the 'Yukta' assisted in administrative duties. \n\nOption 'a' (village-level administration) is incorrect because these officers operated at a higher administrative level than villages. \nOption 'c' (provincial administration) is misleading as these titles do not refer to the highest provincial officers but rather to those managing districts within provinces. \nOption 'd' (level of the central administration) is also incorrect since these roles were not part of the central administration but were focused on local governance within districts.

This provision is actually found in Article 24 of the Constitution, which prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories, but it is not classified under Fundamental Rights; rather, it is a specific right that falls under the broader category of social justice.

The Government budget also shows borrowings of ₹10,000 crores and interest payments of ₹6,000 crores. Which of the following statements are correct? I. Revenue deficit is ₹20,000 crores. II. Fiscal deficit is ₹10,000 crores. III. Primary deficit is ₹4,000 crores. Select the correct answer using the code given below.",

            "d": "I, II and III"
        },
        "correct_answer": "c",
        "solution": "To determine the correctness of the statements, we need to calculate the revenue deficit, fiscal deficit, and primary deficit based on the provided figures. \n\n1. **Revenue Deficit**: This is calculated as Revenue Expenditure - Revenue Receipts. Here, it is ₹80,000 crores (expenditure) - ₹60,000 crores (receipts) = ₹20,000 crores. Thus, Statement I is correct. \n\n2. **Fiscal Deficit**: This is calculated as Total Expenditure - Total Receipts (excluding borrowings). Total Expenditure includes revenue expenditure and interest payments, which is ₹80,000 crores + ₹6,000 crores = ₹86,000 crores. Total Receipts include revenue receipts and borrowings, which is ₹60,000 crores + ₹10,000 crores = ₹70,000 crores. Therefore, Fiscal Deficit = ₹86,000 crores - ₹70,000 crores = ₹16,000 crores. Thus, Statement II is incorrect. \n\n3. **Primary Deficit**: This is calculated as Fiscal Deficit - Interest Payments. Here, it is ₹16,000 crores (fiscal deficit) - ₹6,000 crores (interest payments) = ₹10,000 crores. Thus, Statement III is incorrect. \n\nIn summary, only Statement I is correct, making the correct answer 'c'. \n\n- Statement I is correct. \n- Statement II is incorrect as the fiscal deficit is ₹16,000 crores, not ₹10,000 crores. \n- Statement III is incorrect as the primary deficit is ₹10,000 crores, not ₹4,000 crores.",

This movement called for an end to British rule in India and was marked by widespread protests and civil disobedience. \n\nOption 'a' - 'the Champaran Satyagraha' is incorrect because this was Gandhi's first major involvement in Indian politics in 1917, focusing on the plight of indigo farmers, and did not involve the statement in question. \n\nOption 'b' - 'publicly violating Salt Law at Dandi' is also incorrect. While the Salt March in 1930 was a pivotal event in the Indian independence movement, the specific statement about sedition was not made during this event. \n\nOption 'c' - 'attending the Second Round Table Conference in London' is incorrect as well. Gandhi attended this conference in 1931 to discuss constitutional reforms, but the statement regarding sedition was not made during this time. \n\nThus, the statement is most accurately associated with the Quit India Movement, which was a direct call for immediate independence from British rule.",

Gaganyaan, India's first crewed space mission, aims to send astronauts to space but does not primarily focus on micro-gravity research; its main goal is to demonstrate human spaceflight capabilities. Therefore, while Axiom-1 and SpaDeX support micro-gravity research, Gaganyaan does not fit this criterion. \n\n- Option 'a' (Only one) is incorrect because two missions support micro-gravity research. \n- Option 'c' (All the three) is incorrect as Gaganyaan does not primarily focus on micro-gravity research. \n- Option 'd' (None) is also incorrect since two missions do support micro-gravity research.",

To be eligible to be a Member of a Panchayat at the intermediate level, a person should attain the age of thirty years. III. The Chief Minister of a State constitutes a commission to review the financial position of Panchayats at the intermediate levels and to make recommendations regarding the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and duties, leviable by the State, between the State and Panchayats at the intermediate level.

        "correct_answer": "d",
        "solution": "All three statements are incorrect. \n1. Statement I is incorrect because Panchayats at the intermediate level do not exist in all States; they are present in some States but not in others, as per the provisions of the 73rd Amendment Act, which allows for flexibility in the structure of Panchayati Raj institutions. \n2. Statement II is incorrect because the minimum age to be a member of a Panchayat at the intermediate level is 21 years, not 30 years, as stipulated in Article 243F of the Indian Constitution. \n3. Statement III is also incorrect because the Chief Minister does not constitute a commission for reviewing the financial position of Panchayats; rather, the State Finance Commission is constituted under Article 243I to review the financial position of the Panchayats and make recommendations regarding the distribution of taxes. \nThus, all statements are not correct, making option 'd' the correct answer.",
